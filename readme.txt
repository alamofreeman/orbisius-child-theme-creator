This plugin allows you to quickly create child themes from any theme that you have currently installed on your site/blog.
It also creates rtl.css if exists in the parent theme.

= New and Important =
We have noticed that some child themes created by this plugin do not work as expected.
This is not a bug in this plugin but could be caused by theme authors using custom theme frameworks and/or do not using WordPress'
recommended functions for themes supporting child themes.
